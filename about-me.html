                <h2>My name is John and living the simple life saved my life </h2>
                <p><strong> I used to be a pack rat.</strong>
                    I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even
                    appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>

                    <p>Things were terrible. 
                        I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, 
                        and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>

                        <h3>How I turned things around I</h3>
                  
                  <p><strong> on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> 
                  I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my
                   place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                    It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place,
                     I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>

                      <h3>Now I live the simple</h3>
                      <p>life Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.
                        I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy. 
                        With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to
                         start sharing how I did it,</strong> and how others can benefit from living a simple
                          life as well, which is why I started this site!></p>
